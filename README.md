# Dots
These are the dotfiles for most of my linux config.
### NeoVim
Neovim is my editor of choice. My neovim config now uses Lua. I created a separate config for my older config (nvim-vimscript). The new config uses mason-nvim for handling language-servers. It's not fully complete yet (no null-ls yet).

### Sway
Sway is the WM that I use the most. I used to use i3, but since sway is wayland based, I shifted to it. The config is pretty much the same as my i3 config.

### Waybar
It's the bar that I use with sway. It's highly configurable. Currently I use a minimal config with a material-dark theme.

### Wofi
Wofi is the menu recommended by Sway. I use a basic config that matches with my overall theme.

### Wlogout
I use this as my session manager in sway.
